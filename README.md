ClickBoy is a utility application for your mobile phone that allows you to use your phone as a mouse by rotating it. ClickBoy is implemented on Android and communicates with your computer using the TCP protocol, and a python backend to map the orientation of your phone to a 2D point on your computer.

***
To Run: Download either the [AugmentedGeometry_1.4.apk](https://github.com/WxnChen11/AugmentedR/blob/master/AugmentedGeometry_1.4.apk?raw=true) and install on any android phone. 
>The Non-Stereo version is suitable for those without a Google Cardboard device. The Cardboard Compatible version should be used in conjunction with a Google Cardboard device and will provide a much more immersive experience.

**Required:** [Image Target](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WxnChen11/AugmentedR/master/Image_Target.PNG) Print this image off and hold it in front of your phone camera while running the AugmentedGeometry application. This image must be in view of the phone camera at all times in order for the visualization to appear. It acts as a unique "anchor" point for the app engine and allows the function to be graphed in 3-space accordingly. 

To obtain bigger or smaller visualizations, simply resize the Image Target.
